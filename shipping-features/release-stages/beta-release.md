# Beta Release

> This is an _**optional**_ release stage. Only select features will likely pass through this stage.

For features that will have a great customer impact, it's possible to spend time in this stage to allow external customers a chance to test the feature for us. A feature might spend time here if:

* it is solving a problem in a different/unique way
* it will drastically affect the way users work today
* weâ€™re unsure of the impact it will have on end-customer experience
* we have a lot of requests for the feature
* we want to build testimonials, case studies and references before launching or announcing the feature

## What is the focus of this stage? {#what-to-focus-on-in-this-stage}

When in this stage, the focus is really on confirming that the feature functions as we'd imagined it would and actually solves the problems for the users that it was intended to.

It's entirely possible that we misinterpret the needs of our customers and build something that misses the mark slightly so this stage is a great place to focus on ensuring we're headed in the right direction and will hit the mark.

This stage will possibly also show up a few bugs that were missed in [development review](/shipping-features/release-stages/development.md) and [Internal Release](/shipping-features/release-stages/internal-release.md) but hopefully these are few and far between.

How relevant this stage is to a feature really should be decided on a case by case basis after discussions with both the Growth and Support teams. It may be that, for a particular feature, only a pool of support users is required. On the other hand, maybe a feature warrants opening up to a pool of external beta customers for an extended period of time to flesh out some unknowns in terms of how users intend to use the feature.

## What is the output of this stage?

This stage should yield confidence that your feature:

* Is bug free
* Improves our users' experience of the application
* Solves our users' problems in the best way possible

## Who do I engage in this stage?

This stage is all about external customer testing so you will want to get in touch with James Doman-Pipe and/or Alicia Carney. Let them know that your feature is ready for beta testing and that you're ready for them to open the feature up to external users.

Also let Gary know that this feature is ready for beta testing.

It should come as no surprise to Both the Support and Growth teams that you're requesting beta users for your feature. You should have had discussions with Gary, James and Alicia back in the planning weeks of your cycle to ensure they are across what the release stages might look like for your feature.

## What is my role in this stage?

The beta stage is you get to observe how your feature is used and what the feedback is on it. It's highly likely that James and Alicia will spin up a dedicated Slack channel for the beta stage and invite our external customer beta testers to it. This will allow them to share their experiences, suggestions and feedback on the feature. You should monitor this channel until such time that you, along with the Support and Growth teams, are happy that the feature is ready to move forward to [Public Release](/shipping-features/release-stages/public-release.md).
