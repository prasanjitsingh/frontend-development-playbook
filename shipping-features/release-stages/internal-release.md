# Internal Release

Once your feature has been merged in to `master` it's time to open it up to the entire company. This gives the Support team time to actively test your feature as a part of their day to day support role and also gives your feature some implicit "soaking" time.

At this stage, your feature will be enabled for `support.kayako.com` as well as a list of other internal and developer instances so that everyone in the company can experience the magic that is your new feature.
