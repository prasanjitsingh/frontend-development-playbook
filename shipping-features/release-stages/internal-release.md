# Internal Release

> This is a _**mandatory**_ release stage. All features will pass through this stage

Once your feature has been merged in to `master` it's time to open it up to the entire company. This gives the Support team time to actively test your feature as a part of their day to day support role and also gives your feature some implicit "soaking" time.

At this stage, your feature will be enabled for `support.kayako.com` as well as a list of other internal and developer instances so that everyone in the company can experience the magic that is your new feature.

## What is the focus of this stage? {#what-to-focus-on-in-this-stage}

This stage is all about having the Support team provide focused testing on your particular feature. If this is a feature that is important to the daily tasks of the Support team then they will be actively using it throughout the day and will be ensuring it does what they expect and is bug free. If the feature is a little less relevant to the Support team's normal flow, Gary will assign a pool of support members to actively test the feature.

By enabling internally we also get the benefit of "soaking" time. By enabling the feature for the internal test instances, demo instances and engineers' testing instances, the feature gets to just exist in the app eco-system and which allows us to ensure that it doesn't regress any, seemingly, unrelated parts of the app.

## What is the output of this stage?

This stage should yield confidence that your feature:

* Does not contain any glaring or major bugs
* Solves the problem in the way expected by the users and stakeholders
* Improves the experience of the app

## Who do I engage in this stage?

At this stage we want to open the feature up to everyone in the company.

In order to open the feature up to the entire support team, you'll want to get in touch with Gary McGrath. Let Gary know the feature is now ready for internal release and he will enable the feature for the `support.kayako.com` and the list of internal instances. Gary will also get in touch with Kelly O'Brien to ensure she has everything she needs to provide valuable self service documentation.

Gary will also inform the rest of the company that that the feature is available for internal usage as well as letting the company know when the feature is expected to be available publicly to all users.

## What is my role in this stage?

The main aim here is to monitor Slack for feedback on the feature and action anything related to it. If you had support verify your change via a lightning link before it was merged you shouldnâ€™t be expecting too much in the way of feedback other than the project looks good and is working as expected.

Make sure you check in with Gary, James and Alicia to see if there are any changes to be made and to coordinate when the feature can go to the next stage.
