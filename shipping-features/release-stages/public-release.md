# Public Release

If you've reached this stage, your feature is good to go and ready for release to all of our customers by enabling the feature flag for everyone. Once at this point your job is basically done.

## What is the focus of this stage? {#what-to-focus-on-in-this-stage}

Nothing really. You've done all the good work to get your feature built and ready for public release. It's time to focus on wrapping this bad boy up and moving on to the next exciting challenge.

## What is the output of this stage?

This stage should yield confidence that your feature:

* The feature enabled for all customers
* No entries in bugsnag due to your feature having been released
* A PR ready to go that removes the feature flag, to be merged in the near future

## Who do I engage in this stage?

This is the stage where you can let Gary, James and Alicia know that the feature is ready for public release. James and Alicia will organise for the feature flag to be turned on for all remaining users and will notify the company that the feature is publicly available to everyone.

## What is my role in this stage?

You're job is basically done. You should monitor Bugsnag for a couple of hours after release and ensure there are no new bugs as a result of your feature. You should also have a PR raised against the code base that removes the feature flag you introduced for this feature and get someone to approve it. Consider setting yourself a reminder for a week in the future to swing back around and make sure the PR gets merged. Other than that, grab yourself a coconut water, wind down for a bit and then work out what part of the application you're going to make awesome next.

Great work on shipping another valuable feature and making Kayako a little more awesome 😍 💯 🎉
