# Shipping Features

![](/assets/machine.png)

As Kayako grows as a company and our customers rely more and more on our software to provide amazing customer service we are no longer able to "move fast and break things" as smaller early stage start-ups do. How we ship features to customers needs to become a more predictable process so that we can ensure we are delivering quality software to our end users.

This chapter sets out to define a common language and understanding around the stages a feature might pass through to move from development into our end users' hands

The release stages outlined in this book are based on the conversations and processes that have organically grown out of our company while striving to deliver higher quality software, faster.
