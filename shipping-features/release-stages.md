# Release Stages

We find the most effective way to release high quality, bug free features to users is to allow them to spend time in one or more of the following stages: 

* Development
* Internal Release
* Beta Release
* Public Release

Each of these stages allows us to focus on a slightly different aspect of the feature and will produce different outcomes.

The stages a feature might spend time is determined on a case by case basis and should be done so in discussion with the Growth and Support teams.

Not every feature will spend time in every stage. This is not a pipeline through which features must pass. But more of a way to define pause points during a feature's travels from development to release whereby we can verify and validate that the feature is something we ultimately want to ship to our users.
