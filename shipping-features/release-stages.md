# Release Stages

## What are Release Stages?

Release Stages are really just a way to define points in a lifecycle of a feature between when it's developed and when it's available to our wider customer base.

Releases stages allow us to use a ubiquitous language to describe where a feature is in it's lifecycle. For instance, when someone says that "Feature X" is in Beta, everyone knows that it is being tested by a group of external beta customers before it is released to our entire customer base.

We find the most effective way to release high quality, bug free features to users is to allow them to spend time in one or more of the following stages: 

* Development
* Internal Release
* Beta Release
* Public Release

Each of these stages allows us to focus on a slightly different aspect of the feature and will produce different outcomes.

The stages a feature might spend time is determined on a case by case basis and should be done so in discussion with the Growth and Support teams.

Not every feature will spend time in every stage. This is not a pipeline through which features must pass. But more of a way to define pause points during a feature's travels from development to release whereby we can verify and validate that the feature is something we ultimately want to ship to our users.

## Why Release Stages?

As Kayako and our engineering teams grow, the applications we build become more complex and the number of features we ship increases. As this occurs, we've noticed a few things begin to happen:

1. Sometimes features end up in production without the knowledge of the Support or Growth teams who need to be aware of what is being shipped to users
2. Sometimes features are shipped that don't work as initially expected due to not having been viewed by key stakeholders before release
3. Sometimes otherwise avoidable bugs are shipped to users due to a feature having been rushed out to production

We find that by defining a common language around release stages that features can flow through, we are able to ensure that we uphold the quality of features that go out to customers and that we keep the lines of communication between Engineering, Growth and Support teams open so that all parties are aware of what features are released to users and when.

## Isn't this a bit like "Waterfall"?

Not really. The big irony of "Waterfall" is that being "agile" is really about performing lots of mini "waterfalls" constantly. It's about reducing the feedback loop of a "waterfall" to be as small as possible.

Release stages are really just designed to put a common language and some structure around practices that already happen in an adhoc way. They are about focussing the feedback loops that exist around features and enhancing the communication around the feedback.

Release stages help us ensure we get the right feedback on features at the right time in the feature's life cycle, from development through to public release to all customers.

## Important Parties

There are a number of parties that are critical to feature release stages. These parties are:

### The Frontend Engineering Team

These are the teams that are responsible for building features in to our frontend applications. All engineers should be responsible for driving their features from development through to public release to end users.

### The Support Team

The Support team are critical to helping us build a quality, relevant, product. They use Kayako on a daily basis to allow them to support our own customers. Therefore their input in to the features we build is invaluable.

It's important that the Support team are aware of what features are released to our customers as they are the ones that will ultimately be supporting our customers if they have issues or questions.

The Support team is headed up by [Gary McGrath](//shipping-features/the-team.md#gary-mcgrath) who is the point of contact when wishing to engage the Support team along the feature release stages.

[Kelly O'Brien](//shipping-features/the-team.md#kelly-obrien) is our shining light of amazing self service documentation. It's important that Kelly is kept up to date on the approaching features so she can ensure our customers have all the documentation they need to guide themselves through using our application.

### The Growth Team

The Growth Team are our conduit to our customers from a sales and marketing perspective. We rely on the Growth team to communicate new features to our customers and also organise for select customers to work with us on new beta features.

It's important that the Growth team are aware of what features we are shipping so that they can formulate an effective communication and marketing strategy to inform our users of the new features.

The Growth team is headed up by [James Doman-Pipe](//shipping-features/the-team.md#james-doman-pipe) and [Alicia Carney](//shipping-features/the-team.md#alicia-carney) who are the points of contact when wanting to organise a pool of external beta users and when wanting to release features to the wider end user base.
