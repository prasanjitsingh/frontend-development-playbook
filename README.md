# Frontend Development Playbook

## What's a Playbook?

A playbook is not a rulebook. It’s a set of patterns, practices, and tools that we’ve found to produce great results.

Rather than enforce rules on people, we prefer to guide by example and teach people the patterns that have proven to be successful for us with the vision that they might also see success using them as well as contribute back "plays" that have  
also served them well. We take a lot of inspiration from [The Thoughtbot Playbook](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook).
