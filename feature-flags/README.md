# Feature Flags

![](/assets/tracks.jpg)

At Kayako we value feature flags as a vehicle that allows us to ship features to production quickly, increase quality of the features we do ship and shift the responsibility of enabling features from engineers to the Growth team.



This section will strive to illustrate why we value feature flags as an integral part of our development workflow, when we should consider using feature flags in our development workflow and what that looks like in practice.



In this section you will find information on:

* Why we use feature flags
* When to use feature flags
* Types of feature flags and their naming conventions
* Feature flagging best practices
